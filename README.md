loop-wordpress-popular-post
===========================

You can create WordPress loop from WordPress Popular Post plugin's database,
and you can use original design template to display ranking.

I modified only "wordpress-popular-posts/wordpress-popular-posts.php" originated from [WordPress Popular Posts](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/) version 2.2.1,
and added only a function "get_popular_posts_ids".
